    <h1>History of the Seven Kingdoms</h1>
    <p>In the beginning, the world was a chaotic and unformed mass, ruled by the powerful gods who were locked in eternal conflict with each other. 
        The gods had created the world out of nothingness, but they could not agree on how it should be ruled, and so they fought and schemed and plotted against each other,
         using the mortals as pawns in their never-ending game.</p>

    <p>

        One day, the gods grew tired of their endless conflict, and they decided to create a new world, a world that would be ruled by men instead of gods. 
        They gathered together and created the first humans, imbuing them with the power to shape the world according to their own desires. 
        The gods then withdrew from the mortal world, leaving it to the humans to create their own kingdoms and civilizations.
    </p>

    <p>
    The humans quickly spread out across the land, building cities and kingdoms and empires. But the gods did not leave the world completely. 
    They watched from afar, occasionally intervening in mortal affairs when it suited their purposes.

    </p>

    <p>
        Eventually, the gods grew tired of the endless bloodshed and destruction, and they withdrew once again from the mortal world, 
        leaving the humans to pick up the pieces and rebuild their shattered kingdoms.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the war had left its mark on the world. The kingdoms that had been created during the conflict were now filled with powerful relics and artifacts, 
        imbued with the magic and power of the gods. 
        These relics would go on to shape the destiny of the kingdoms, and the struggle for their control would be the cause of many wars and conflicts in the years to come.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are a Soultouched, one of the few able to wield the power of the gods with some safety. Will you use their power to save Westerland, or destroy it?
