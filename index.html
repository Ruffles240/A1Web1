        <p class = "floated">Welcome traveller to the Westerland, powered by the Mythras game engine. 
            Here you will find friend and foe, sea and storm, death and life, ice and fire.

        Before the Conquest, Westerland was ruled by Seven Kingdoms, tell me traveller, to which Kingdom do you wish to join? Shall you raid with the Ironborn 
            or stand stalwart with the North? Or perhaps live in peace in the Reach? The choice is yours.
        Join a Kingdom, then proceed to the Character Creation form to live out your time in Westerland!</p>

        <br> 
        <br>
        <h4 id = "reach">The Reach</h4>
        <p>Most bountiful of the kingdoms, the Reach has never lacked for a fruitful harvest. Nor well trained knights and legions of men at arms to protect their bounties</p>
        <p>Division and distrust among the powerful lords has grown however. Tell me Reachman, will you unite them?</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h4 id = "north">The North</h4>
        <p>Cold and grim, yet with beauty of it's own, the North stands as the defenders of the kingdoms against the wildling threat, and perhaps other things that lurk beyond the Wall</p>
        <p>Go forth Northman, protect the realms.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h4 id = "iron">The Steel Islands</h4>
        <p>We Do Not Sow. These are the words of House SilverSad, and true they are. For the Iron Islands have little that they have made, and much they will take</p>
        <p>Go forth Northman, protect the realms.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <div>
        <h4 id = "morne">Morne</h4>
        <p>Dorne, founded by all three peoples of Westeros by the Rhoynish warrior queen Nymeria, this land has stood for a thousand years as the beacon of what it means to be Dornish.</p>
        <p>Valyrians have come once again to attack your people. Stand Dornishman, and do not back down!</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        </div>
        <div id ="Vale">
        <h4 id = "vale">The Valish</h4>
        <p>As High as Honor. That is what was said a thousand years ago by Ser Artys Arrys, and evermore do the people of the Vale hold their honour in highest of esteems</p>
        <p>Protect the Vale, be proud and honourable young knight.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        </div >
        <h4 id = "west">The Western Mountains</h4>
        <p>Richest of the Kingdoms and protected by the evernoble house Lannister, the Westerlands lack not for gold or harvest.</p>
        <p>Yet the days grow dark in the Century of Blood, Ironborn have taken heed of the Westerlands' wealth and seek to take it for themselves. 
            Defend yourselves warriors of the West!</p>
            <br> 
            <br>
            <br> 
            <br>
        <h4 id = "storm">The Storm Peaks</h4>
        <p>Ours is the Fury. These are the words of House Storm, and ever have they kept them. For like their castle of Storm's End, the Durrandons spite the gods to this day.</p>
        <p>Rush forward like the storm you are, young knight.</p>
